# Block Ops 2
This is the source code for the Last Man/Team Standing gametype.

### What's changed between 1 & 2?
Block Ops has been completely rewritten from scratch with a new mindset.
Block Ops 1 was very buggy and the code was very inefficent, the game would take
up a lot more memory (RAM) then it was supposed to and some features did not work
well with others. I (TekkitCommando) changed that in my rewrite from my older Block Ops
that was taken down some time ago because of how hard it was to fix bugs and maintain it
in general. The new Block Ops is very resource efficient, all the features work well with
each other and MANY bugs were fixed. Want some more great news? Block Ops did not only get
a complete code rewrite but a completely new and graphic friendly x256 3D Texture Pack!

Note: People that can't run the 3D Texture Pack will be able to download a x32 or x64 texture
pack when the server is ready for players.

### What's the license?
All the projects in the Block Ops series are licensed under the "No License" and if you are
not familiar with the license really it just states that you may use the plugin on your server
whether your server is commercial or not but you may NOT distribute, modify, or sublicense the
code. I have put this on GitHub so you may fork this and view the code. I am allowing modification
of the code only if your modifications are sent back in a PR to this main repo. If we do not pull
the modifications you may still use the modifications since you did your part and sent the PR in
the first place.
